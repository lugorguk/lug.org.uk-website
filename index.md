The UK Linux User Groups organisation, also known as lug.org.uk, is dedicated to providing technical services for User, Support or Interest Groups 
who are interested in, or advocate for Permissive Licenses (e.g. Free Software, Open Source Software and Linux Distribution groups) in the United Kingdom.

[Our list of Linux User Groups or other associated groups in the United Kingdom is available from this page](lugs).

We are able to offer to groups free hosting of web sites and email addresses, run mailing lists and provide DNS hosting services.

If you run a group which you feel is in line with our offer, or are thinking of starting one, please [take a look into applying](apply).
