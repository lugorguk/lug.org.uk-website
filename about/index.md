lug.org.uk is primarily a focal point for Linux users in the UK, and secondly a resource provider for Linux User Groups, enabling them to maintain a web presence.

<h2>History</h2>

This site was the original idea of Mark Lewis and it was created in 1997, when he registered the domain name and first offered free registrations to user groups. Although in recent times Mark has become busy with personal commitments, he still checks in with the community when his schedule permits.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

1. To provide an initial point for Linux users and non-users to search for LUGs in a specific area.<br><br>The [UK LUG list](/lugs) shows where groups currently are and how they can be contacted.<br><br>LUGs are a local community of Linux users of all levels that gather to share a broad spectrum of Linux information. Both novice and experienced Linux users will find LUGs a useful arena to debate and enquire personal experiences of Linux and indeed, pose those questions they need answering.
2. To provide resources to freely allow LUGMasters to setup their own local Linux User Group, with our aid, using the lug.org.uk domain name.

<a name="start_a_lug"><h2>How to start a LUG</h2>

Before you create a LUG, there are a number of things you should consider:

* Is there an existing LUG in the area? Look at neighbouring areas, join their mailing lists and ask about their coverage.
* Do you have a starter group of members already interested?
  * Join neighbouring LUGs and ask there to find out if there's interest.
  * Ask on the [uk.comp.os.linux](news:uk.comp.os.linux) newsgroup as well.
* In our experience, non-geographical LUGs don't tend to work very well. There are a few in existence, but few are large, and many founder very quickly. Think carefully about sustainability before trying to create a non-geographical LUG.
* A domain name of "foo.lug.org.uk" is preferable to "foolug.lug.org.uk". You should also check that there isn't already a LUG with that domain name on lug.org.uk.

Once you've decided on a name and coverage area for your LUG, you should:

* Apply for use of lug.org.uk server facilities.
  * We will also automatically sign you up to the lugmaster mailing list, where most of the UK LUG organisers talk about issues of relevance to all LUGs in the UK.
* Announce your achievements:
  * On the [uk.comp.os.linux](news:uk.comp.os.linux) newsgroup
  * Advise the UK Linux Magazines (for example, 'Linux Format' and 'Linux Magazine') of your new LUG details for publication
  * Maybe on other local LUG mailing lists (with permission of course)
  * Enjoy your new LUG, and have fun
